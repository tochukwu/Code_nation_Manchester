                        As we all know that the tool need depends on the task being undertaken. for this project  the  tools needed are already mentioned above, however before strarting off on the  projects  one most  strategice and  plan-out what needs to be done (as seen in 1.3). 
                        The next step would  then looking at the business behind the site. and  their  scale / size. This  would then influence the type of website  to be made  to cope with their type of clients.
                        Companies gereneally fall under one or more of the following;
                        Simple: (business sites, small online stores) where the complexity it's not vert high and most of the functions are already implemented in the platform that provides the web service. Obviously, this comes with huge restrictions on their functionality and appearance.
                        Medium: (larger online stores, national-scale portals...) such projects are usually built around frameworks, which are a functional block with predefined features, which increases the speed rate of the project but will probably come with some limitations when it comes to implementing features, but it will always be cheaper than using a High Level programing code.
                        Large: such as social networks, where the project's core is developed in a high level (HL) programming language and the need for functionality, flexibility and data exchange are at the highest level.
                        
                        So depending not only on the scale of the project but also the features you want to implement into it you can then identify how to tackle your project. [1]

                            In my view Trello is a software platfrom that helps you platfrom a number of agile cermemonies  such as the sprint and  listing the  project backlog.The solution's "Kanban methodology helps with this.
                            This is the same  methodology I Implemented this project in. I divided the different sections of my assignment into smaller tasks? That becomes very handy when it comes to facing any assignment, and can also be used to share information of the project process to members of a team if working with a group. 
                             Slack was really useful to maintain contact with the members of my team. Not all of us had exchanged phone numbers, so in order to inform of any changes while we were not together, or to make important decisions that needed to be made as soon as possible, we used this app to do so.

                        <p>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
                                GDPR impact digital projects?
                                  The GDPR itself was  an expansion on the DPA (Data Protection Act) which sets guidelines on how data is handled  within the EU economic region.
                                With regards to the  GDPR’s  to legal guidelines and constraints that affect a business that runs digital projects it's very similar to any other company, but with a special emphasis on copyright law (which we will disscuss later on) and data protection, which in Europe is underlined by the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation.
                                This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
                                Expansion made under the  GDPR includes ;<br>
                                The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
                                <br>
                                The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
                                <br>
                                The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
                                <br>
                                The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
                               <br>
                                The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
                                <br>
                                The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
                                <br>
                                The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
                                <br>
                                The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
                               <br>
                                The expansion was the union’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain
