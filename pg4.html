            <ul class="abtme">
                <p>     For the Dev stage of my project the tool software tools I used  were Trello and  Visual Studio Code.<br>
                       <h4> Using Trello</h4>
                        Trello has helped me out a great deal when dividing the different parts of the unit outcomes and then piecing it all together, specially when it comes to the layout of the research part. Having different cards with the different sections made the job of adding all the content into an HTML file much easier.
                        <br>
                        <h4>Using Visual Studio Code</h4>
                        Visual Studio Code was really easy to learn although to be fair I already used the full version of visual studio so I found this editor was spartan so I had to do most of the heavy lifting , like  making the nav bar  setting the  html tags for header and  footer which ate up about 10% of the dev time

                            <h4>Trello:</h4>
                             Trello was useful as it introduced me to more current industry standards of teamwork management. In my case it enabled showcase my work.
                            Trello allowed  me to showcase my  soruce code and  progress. It allowed me to properly plan out  my work so I could be in more  control
                            <br>

                            <h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>
                            as I stated ealier I believe have access to the full verson. so I felt that  as this was a simple editor  it was lacking making me have to do the  heavy lifiting  (i.e. having to input the nav, body and  header tags myself.). 
                            So while this IDE  met the MVP it was lacking in so many other ways. Now I know the question then arries that "why not  BYOD or work on at home?". Simple , my version of the software was  continiously requesting that  allow it to modfy the file for me. Doing that  would have ment that the software  onsite  would no longer beable to view or edit the web soruce code as it has become significantly bigger in volume and  class dependancies .
                             I did n't  make much use of slack for this project.

                            For version 2.0 I will implement all the features that I didn’t at the beginning both in the UI and  in the background.
                            i) I will elicit google analysis code to track visits to my site to be able to ascertain where my visitors are from.
                            ii) I will implement a simple webform so people can ask me questions and I will get back to them if they want to know more about me.
                            
                            iii) I will implement asynchronous feature in the site. like different sections displaying different information from different aspects of my portfolio
                            2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
                            Planning & Research:
                            In my opinion this stage came together rather swimmingly. Using Trello board  I was able to use  Trello board  to compartmentalize each state of the task. This enabled me to more easily track each component of the Project
                            WebDev; 
                            I do believe my sites meets the Minimum Viable Product as the site those works. Although I have previous webdev, experience, the process gave me a more appreciation for the lengthy leg work that goes into working from a blank html file with not previous template or framework to pull from. I did learn more current ways of writing Js (JavaScript) code which I thought was really good.
                            While I feel I could have done more, and I will when I make major improvements to version 2. I am also great did get assistance from colleagues and my Lecturer which enabled me troubleshoot issues that arose

                                        I really can't find any drawbacks on the tools I used during the process. Most of the problems I encountered were styling related. Trello has been really useful as I said before and I have become to consider it as a must have application to carry out my future projects.
Regarding Visual Studio Code it has been really intuitive in order to correct some minor typing mistakes from time to time.

                               My approach for this version was deprecate all non-essential functions and features. This version’s UI looks more like a cooperate blog. In version 2 I will add more source code to handle load time and other issues.

                    These are two separate tasks that usually seem to go hand in hand. Productivity is achieved  by completing tasks or mile stones in a short period of time and being efficient means finding the best was of doing a particular task in relation to a given constrain
                    List of ways to improve productivity include;
                    <br>
                    ⦁	Assigning your time to the most relevant tasks<br>
                    ⦁	Investing time in yourself by continuously learning and keeping up-to-date<br>
                    ⦁	Taking breaks as often as possible in order to rewire your brain’s synapsis to reduce the possibility of burn out<br>
