                    1.2 The skills, method and resources needed would depend on the task and the person(s)  completeting the task. 
                    The  name digital projects can varry from a digital  marketing  to videos rendering to web / software (native) dev. With regards to  software development. The skills  the persons undertaking the project will need are, 
                    <h4> Problem solving:</h4>
                    This is a more elusive skillset that  many people dont have or know how to cultivate. This skillset is rather  an almagamation of different skills and  qualities such as  an analitical mind, ability to sequencially grasp and breakdown compartmentalise an issue before  coming up with a heuristic or bespoke solution (given extrenal factors ).
                    Aside from skillsets there are tools that are quentesential inorder to fix certain problems such as
                    <h4>Trello:</h4>
                    A managemnet  a tool built on the Japanese management "kanban" principle, which involves consistent monitoring of all production phases. It is a great tool for standard projects and is convenient for both command directives and individual assignments. The interface consists of different boards, which represent projects or processes in the company. Each board consists of lists of tasks, cards with descriptions, comments, files, color tags and deadlines. The menu can be displayed as a calendar. The basic functionality of Trello is free and allows you to work with almost no restrictions.
                    Another  rathern ubiqutious tool within the software dev world is slack,
                    <h4>Slack</h4>
                    Slack (a web-service, and application available for desktop, iOS and Android that helps individuals or groups to interact with colleagues or customers on any issues concerning projects. This is a simple application with a very simple and intuitive user interface. You can create a profile, send files, and send and read messages. Private groups are called "channels" and the messages sent within the channel are visible only to the participants of that particular channel. Slack supports more than 100 web services, including the popular Dropbox, Twitter, Google Docs and even Trello, mentioned above. You can use Slack to integrate any of these services and get notifications when there are any changes and activities)

                <h2> 1.4 What causes digital projects to fail,</h2>
                <ul class="mordnbizz">
                   
                    As was covered in  section 1.2 "what makes digital projects to succeed". The tools that are  needed to carry out the project and what skills are usually needed in order to face certain complications during the development phase. So when we ask ourselves what makes digital projects to fail, we can get to the conclusion that:
                    Even though it's a digital project first and foremost it's a business initiative, so it's very likely that without a well thought out business management plan that can adjust the digital scope towards it's actual goal, the project is destined to bump into many unexpected inconvenients and fail . Also good project plan should include reduncancies and fail safes to help mitigates cases in which the project gets stuck in a certain part of the development process, making so that tweaks or alternative solutions may be reached to keep it running.
                    <h4>Lack of or no communication;</h4> between dev team and other departments. Over the last sections we talked about how communication it's vital to make a project run. This becomes even more important when the project requieres several departments to work together or depending on one another. You can picture it as: the digital part of the process is the channel from which the idea of the project is carried out.
                    These are common problems that an inadquate undestanding of business process may cause, so having a flexible project that can react to problems and a broad scope of all the perspectives that have to be considered can help avoid total disaster.
