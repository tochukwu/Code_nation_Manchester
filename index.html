            <h2>1.0 About  Me</h2>
            <ul class="abtme">
                <p>  
                I do have  a tech background as I have attended some university and have a  good grasp and exprience in a smorgasbord of  developmenr laguages and technologies Ranging from  Developing simple apps for the iOS palform in Objective C to eliciting  python for Data science analysis. I have  also had the  opportunity to  do backend works  in Javascript  eliciting  Node.js.
                Aside from  my educational and profesional background. In my  personal life I have developed different neural nets and other  technoligies  to automate  diffrent  aspects of my life. 
                An example of  which is a project  that is still on going and  is ittreative for me. is   I have  code in .py that reads my emails to me every morining  and uses tensorflow  to  analise the  email and give me additional information like if the email sounds angry or sad  or nutral. It aslo analises   any literature and gives me the theme and  gerneral information about that given piece of litterature.
                Someone  onece said if you do what  you do for work in your free time then you are doing the right thing.
                My reason for  going with  Code Nation is rather simple,   for the past 24 months I have been engaged in stints that  were not  within the IT industry, I missed the  trill and exhilaraton that came  with writing code and  being part of the  development  community  so I decided to return but inorder to ensure  my knowledge and skillset was still relevant I chose to join a coding programme that I felt would be challanging  yet enjoyable and code nation matched my critera. I had a meeting  with one of the comapny's emissaries, I was  happy with what I heard and was  eager  to start fast forward 3 weeks later and I'm on a course with them and enjoying every minitue of it

                    <p>The  topic itself is multifaceted, no business would not be able to function in the modern age without using some form of IT or the other, from  implementing  predictive analysis software on networked farm  machinery  such as  plows to  tractors to  preemptively diagnose issues  with the machinery before they even develop and become an issue or interrupt/holt farming activities . To the automated voice system used in customer service to help direct customer(s) request, enquiries or complaints to the right department in order to better resolve it, or  self-driving  trucks  for  the trucking and  logistics sector.

                        Due to the current climate and the fast-paced nature of trades and business itself, it is ever more paramount that Information Technology systems are elicited in order to facilitate more nimble business decisions without loose of accuray. A decade ago systems like CRMs and other database management systems  were considered  cutting edge now Big data, Google Analytics, AWS and other Decision Engines are  used  to give berter foresight in order to aid the human agents make a decision
